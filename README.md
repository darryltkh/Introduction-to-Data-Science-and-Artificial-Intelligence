# Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Project
Classification of Earthquake Damage Severity based on building characteristics

This project is done for the Singapore NTU SCSE module CE1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. It is based off an online competition on [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/).
However, as this is an academic project, this work is not allowed to be submitted for the competition.

Aim of the project: Predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal.

How this project was conducted:
- We start off by analysing the characterisitcs of the buildings in Nepal based on the dataset given and see if there is any correlation that can be exploited.
- We explore all possible basic machine learning techniques that can be used in this context.
- We compare the results of each technique.

Results:
| Machine Learning Technique | F1 Score |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ADA Boost | 70.9% |
| Artificial Neural Network | 70.8% |
| Naive Bayes | 40.0% |
| XGBoost Classifier | 58.7% |
